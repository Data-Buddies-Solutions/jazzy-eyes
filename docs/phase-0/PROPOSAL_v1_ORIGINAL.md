1. Project Overview
This project aims to build a modern, intelligent data pipeline for a boutique optical business, transforming a fragmented, manual tracking process into a seamless and data-driven approach. The goal is to eliminate inefficiency, unlock deep business insights, and enable smarter inventory and purchasing decisions.
The system will handle every stage of the optical data lifecycle:
QR Based Inventory Tracker: Each pair of glasses will receive a unique QR code linked to a central database record. Staff can scan the code at the point of sale, which replaces the manual tallying systems and ensures accurate, real-time data capture for every frame sold.


Data Pipeline & Centralized Database: All frame, brand, and sales data will be stored in a secure database. The pipeline is designed to be scalable, and automated. Each record links product details, gender category, cost, retail price, and sale date, creating a single source of truth for optical business analytics.


Dashboard & Analytics Interface: A clean, intuitive web dashboard will provide instant visibility into sales, inventory performance, and profitability.



Result: A fully modernized infrastructure that: eliminates manual tracking and errors, provides real-time analytics and reporting, and enables data-driven buying decisions. This upgrade not only reduces waste and inefficiency but also transforms inventory management into a strategic growth engine for the business.

2. Project Phases and Deliverables
Phase 1: QR Generation & Frame Onboarding
QR ID & Schema: Encodes key frame information (brand, model, color, price, and unique Frame ID) into each QR code. This creates a consistent, scannable data structure across all inventory.


Labeling Workflow: QR codes can be batch-generated directly from brand invoices or CSV uploads, then printed as ready-to-use labels.


Event Model: Every scan will automatically log an event (timestamp, user, and device) for each sale


Phase 2: Data Pipeline & Centralized Database
Central Database: Stores all frame, sales, and event data in one place, giving complete visibility into performance and history.


Data Ingestion: Sales and inventory updates automatically feed into the system through simple uploads or scan events.


Analytics Foundations: The data pipeline will support key metrics such as sell-through rate, profit margin, brand performance, and stock turnover.

Phase 3: Analytics Dashboard & Reporting
Dashboard Interface: Simple, visual, and easy to navigate. Key sections include sales overview, top brands, gender breakdown, reorder recommendations, and overall profitability.

3. Expected ROI and Value
This system isn’t just about tracking inventory more cleanly, it’s about turning every frame into a smarter, faster-moving profit engine. By improving how and when frames are reordered, the business can reduce cash tied up on shelves, avoid missed sales from stockouts, and capture more margin from top-selling products.
